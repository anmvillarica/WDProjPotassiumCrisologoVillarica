            When we were first thinking about what kind of website to make, we both
            knew that we wanted to make something that was a little complicated.
            We wanted to be challenged by this project because we knew that we
            could do it and learn a lot along the way.

            The inspiration for a game came from coding games such as Scratch and
            Google Doodle: Coding. The concept of making a game that taught the very
            basics of coding with JavaScript and using HTML was exciting because
            we hadn’t coded or designed a game before.

            Overall, we really enjoyed making this project because we were able to
            learn a lot about what goes into making websites and to a certain
            extent, games.
