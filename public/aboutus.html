        <p>
            I designed the webpages, two of our sprites, and the backgrounds for our game. 
            I enjoy making art and designing with HTML. I’ve been getting into older Pokemon games 
            (I’ve been trying to finish Pokemon: Gold and Silver), 
            and I’ve been meaning to try pixel art for a while. 
            That was my inspiration for the aesthetic of our game.  <br><br>

            It was very cool to make a legitimate website with someone else, 
            and I am very grateful to Arianna for being the best partner. 
            It’s a very cute project all in all, and I am proud of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ever since I was small, I've loved working with loops, functions and animations. I really
            enjoyed making sprites move after certain events and triggers. I got my inspiration from
            the various RPG games that I've played, such as RPG Maker, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, and Zelda.

            <br><br>

            Tala's art and css files were so amazing!! I really enjoyed seeing how our work went from 
            black and white basic html files to fully-furnished html-css-js pages that are very cool and fun.
            This is one of my first finished projects, and I'm super proud with what we have accomplished. :D
